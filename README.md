    Project Description: Automated Data Correction for University Recreation

Every semester, the University Recreation receives a list of around 20,000 active students to determine access eligibility. However, the list often contains incorrect information that needs to be set to default values for proper integration with the data upload program. Previously, this task required manually examining and correcting each entry, which was time-consuming and prone to human error.

To streamline this process, I developed a Python script that automates the identification and correction of erroneous data in the student list. The script efficiently scans the list, identifies incorrect data, and fixes it. It then outputs four CSV files with the corrected data. This automation significantly reduces the time required for data processing and ensures accuracy, eliminating the risk of human error.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This program was specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by the University's Recreation department. It takes in to account the department's needs to accurately verify and manage a large list of active students, ensuring that only eligible individuals are granted access o the facilities. By automating the process of identifying and correcting errors in student data, the program effectively resolves the issues that previously required manual intervention and was susceptible to human error.
